Our client, a startup boutique coffee shop and cafe, would like to open their flagship location near Berczy Park in Toronto. They belive that this location within Toronto will provide good foot traffic and ultimately help establish the brand. They are aware of competition from other existing local and franchise coffee shops in the neighborhood, but they feel their unique ambience and custom coffee and pastry selections will provide a different experience for their customers. They have asked me to do a martket study of existing cafes in the area as well as other businesses to determine if this is a good location for their store.
